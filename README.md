**Official Theme**: Built to Scale

**Unofficial Theme (as set by my partner)**: Cats! ðŸ˜¸


Ideas:
------

Selected idea:

- **The Blob (but the blob has a cute cat face)**  
  Challenges:
  - Need a lot of assets for different scales
  - Would be fun to move up to gobbling up stars, but the jump from planetary mass to star mass may break suspension of
    disbelief
  - Soft body physics on the blob a total new area for me
  - No challenge... could have other blobs that could eat you

But feel free to use any of these if you come across this ðŸ˜œ:

- **Infinite Factory Game (but maybe a Cat Sanctuary)**  
    Challenges:
  - Wave function collapse
  - Factory Mechanics
  - Grids
  - Very ambitious
- **A Card game where each player can add a card with rules** (The more people play, the more cards will exist)  
  Challenges:
  - Need a way to let players construct rules within the mechanics of the game 
  - Not sure if requiring sign in is allowed 
  - Needs a server running somewhere to store new player invented rules
  - Probably not fun, certainly not consistent
- **A tower building game like Tower of Goo, but the pieces are Cats in different poses**  
  Challenges:
  - Rigid body physics could be unpredictable but should be easy to implement 
  - Probably a bit too simplistic
- **Grow a plant in a desert -> cover the desert in foliage**  
  Challenges:
  - Topical, but maybe not fun
  - No cats
